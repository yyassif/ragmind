---

RAGMind provides a powerful feature to share your brains with others. This can be done by sharing with individuals via their emails and assigning them specific rights. The rights can be categorized into three types: Viewer, Editor, and Owner.

## Types of User Rights

Each user type has different levels of access and capabilities within a shared brain. Here's a breakdown:

A viewer has the right to ask questions to the brain. They can interact with the brain but cannot modify or delete any information.
</Card>

<Card title="Editor" icon="pen">
  An editor has more rights than a viewer. They can not only ask questions but
  also download files from the brain. However, they cannot delete any files.

<Card title="Owner" icon="user-crown">
An owner has the highest level of rights. They can ask questions, download files, and even delete files from the brain.

## How to Share a Brain

Sharing a brain is a straightforward process. Follow these steps:

<Steps>
<Step title="Go to Brain Studio"></Step>

<Step title="Choose the brain that you want to share"></Step>

<Step title="Click on People Tab"></Step>

<Step title="Enter the email address and choose a rol."></Step>

<Step title="Send the invitation"></Step>
</Steps>

The person will receive an email with an invitation to access the brain. They can accept the invitation and start interacting with the brain based on the rights assigned to them.

<Tip>
  If the person you are sharing the brain with does not have a RAGMind account,
  they will be asked to create one before they can access the brain.
</Tip>
<Warning>
  Only one mail is sent to the person you are sharing the brain with. If they
  lose the mail, they will not be able to access the brain. In such a case, you
  will have to share the brain again.
</Warning>
<Info>
  Remember, sharing brains in RAGMind is a great way to collaborate with your
  team or share information with others. Make sure to assign the appropriate
  rights to ensure the security and integrity of your information.
