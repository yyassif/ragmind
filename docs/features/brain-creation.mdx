## Create Brains connected to Specific Data Sources

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a type of Brain">
    Choose the type of Brain you want to use, based on the data source you wish
    to interact with.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define your Brain identity">
    Name your Brain and provide a detailed description. The better the
    description, the more effective it will be because when you search for
    information in RAGMind without specifying the Brain you want to interact
    with, RAGMind will automatically select the best Brain to answer your
    question based on its description.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Feed your Brain">
    If necessary, feed your brain with data that it can store.
