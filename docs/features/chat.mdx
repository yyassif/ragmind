    <Card title="Chat with your Brains" icon="message">
        You can chat with each of your brains, which will give you responses based on the knowledge you have provided them.
    </Card>

<Tip>
  In the same thread, you can decide to talk to multiple brains. For example,
  ask a question to a first brain of the 'Docs & URLs' type and reformulate the
  response using a 'GPT4' type brain.
