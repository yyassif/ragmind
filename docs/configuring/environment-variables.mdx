# Environment variables

You have two environment files in the root of the project:

The .env file is used to configure the app server. It contains the following variables:

### Backend Environment File

The backend environment file is used to configure the backend server. It contains the following variables:

- `SUPABASE_URL`: The connection string to the project's Supabase application, which is a suite of open source tools that provide functionality similar to Firebase.

- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`: Used for server-side requests to authenticate with Supabase, providing administrative access to the database and other services.

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: The key required to authenticate requests to OpenAI's API for accessing their services, such as language models like GPT-3 or GPT-4.

- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: A secret key for signing and verifying JSON Web Tokens, used in the authentication process to secure the tokens exchanged between client and server.

- `CELERY_BROKER_URL`: The URL of the message broker for Celery (using Redis), which is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing.

- `RESEND_API_KEY`: The API key for a service referred to as "RESEND," which likely deals with email sending or processing.

- `RESEND_EMAIL_ADDRESS`: The email address used by the "RESEND" service, possibly as the sender's address for onboarding communications.

- `RESEND_CONTACT_SALES_FROM`: The sender's email address for sales-related inquiries sent through the "RESEND" service.

- `RESEND_CONTACT_SALES_TO`: The recipient's email address for sales inquiries using the "RESEND" service.

### Frontend Environment File

The frontend environment file is used to configure the frontend application. It contains the following variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENV`: Specifies the environment in which the Next.js application is running (e.g., local, development, production).

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`: The URL where the backend of the application is running, used to make server-side requests.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_URL`: The URL where the frontend of the application is accessible. The asterisk (\*) may indicate that any port can be used when running locally.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: The connection string to the project's Supabase application for the frontend to interact with Supabase services.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: The public 'anonymous' key for Supabase that is used in the frontend for services that don't require full user authentication.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_MODES`: The authentication modes supported by the application, such as magic link, password-based authentication, and Google Single Sign-On (SSO).

### Configuring BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY

To use the Brave Search functionality within RAGMind, you need to configure the `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` in your environment. Here's how to obtain and set up your API key:

1. **Create a Brave Search Account**: Visit [Brave Search](https://api.search.brave.com/app/keys) and sign up for an account if you haven't already.
2. **Obtain API Key**: Once logged in, navigate to the developer settings or API section to generate a new API key for your application.
3. **Configure .env File**: Add the following line to your `.env` file in the root of the RAGMind project:
   ```
   BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_brave_search_api_key_here
   ```
   Replace `your_brave_search_api_key_here` with the actual API key you obtained from Brave Search.

By configuring the `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`, you enable RAGMind to perform web searches using Brave Search's capabilities directly from within the application.
